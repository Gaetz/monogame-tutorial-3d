Step 1 : Load and display the 3D Ship on screen with the content manager
Step 2 : Move the ship, using vector 3 and inputs
Step 3 : Aim and rotate the ship, using matrices / transform
Step 4 : Shoot and make projectiles collide
Step 5 : Make projectiles collide
Step 6 : Get a power up, a parametrable shooting system
Step 7 : A moving enemy, which can shoot
Step 8 : Waves of enemies
Step 9 : Particles and explosions
Step 10 : Sounds and music
Step 11 : Graphics polishing with Basic effect [using the shader to signal when enemies are hit etc.]
Step 12 : Conversations and 2d UI
Step 13 : A moving floor [either just 1 or 2 scroling planes with texture, or a mountain system with vertex shader and noise. But maybe this is too advanced for a first 3d tutorial ?]
Step 14 : Better aiming ?
